 ## Description
 
 **wordle-solver** aims to find the solution for the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game in as few guesses as possible.
 It features a light user interface from which the user can start and read the solution data (solution and the number of needed guesses). The program works by having an existing list of possible words, starting with a best possible word (a 5-letter word that has no duplicate letters and at least 2 vowels) and programatically filtering out words based on the entered word data.
